# ReportFX
We will create a web application which will allow users to upload data in a specific standard format like CSV. The report engine will present the user with a fancy report, complete with graphs and diagrams like pie charts, bar charts and histograms. The engine will also generate additional statistics based on the provided data like mean, standard deviation and variance. The report will allow easier analysis of the data.

## Testing the Application
```python3 manage.py test```

## Technology Stack Used
